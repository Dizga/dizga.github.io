│<span class="r5">              </span>│<span class="r5"> much as a book. I can justify this by explaining that the ball is worth 6 points to me, which is </span>│
│<span class="r5">              </span>│<span class="r5"> 3 times the value of a book (2 points). This is because my utility values are 2 for books and 6  </span>│

│<span class="r7">              </span>│<span class="r7"> book and the ball. This means they will have 1 book, 2 hats, and the ball. The utility of the    </span>│
│<span class="r7">              </span>│<span class="r7"> items I will take is 4, which is the value of 1 book. My partner&#x27;s utility for the items they    </span>│
│<span class="r7">              </span>│<span class="r7"> will take is 2 + 6 = 8. This seems like a good deal for both of us, but I should consider        </span>│
